## Supported Versions

Here's a list of all the versions to be released on PyPI.

Those versions with a :white_check_mark: are supported, maybe they are stable or being developed right now. 
Those with a :warning: are still being stable, but will be deprecated or even yanked in the future. And those with an :x:
will no longer be supported.

| Version | Supported          | Status          |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 1.0.0   | :x:                | On development  |
